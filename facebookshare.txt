We can now share anything on facebook by just sending some parameter to "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?"
in the param 'u'(url) we have to pass the url which we want to share on facebook.

for eg
<%= link_to image_tag('fb_share.png'), "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=wisdom.vinsol.com/#{current_user.username}", :onclick=>"window.open(this.href,'create_company', 'height=200, width=600');return false;"%>

in this case i want to share the users profile link on facebook so in the parameter 'u' i have passed the url link.

this will by default share a simple link on facebook but if we want to make the link more expressive we can do it by meta tags

like


 <meta property="og:title" content="View my profile" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="Wisdom 2.0 summit" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="/wisdom.jpg"/>

these meta tags will come in the head section of the html page


their are many other meta tags about which you can read from here
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraphprotocol/

by following these steps you can easily share a link through facebook without using any gem
